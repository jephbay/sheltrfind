            <p>New to <b>shelterFind?</b>  Don’t worry, this guide is here to help in your quest to add a new facility. The steps are indicated below;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In the home page where you have the list of facilities, tap on “Profile” - the last menu to the right in the menus at the bottom of your screen.</li>
            <li>Tapping on “Profile” opens a list of options available for the profile menu. Look for “Lift a facility”
                (The first item) in the options. This option is available if you have never added a facility in this app, but for a user who has a facility and would
                like to add another or edit the existing facility, the “Lift a facility” option would be replaced with the “Manage” option.</li>
            <li> After selecting the “Lift a facility” option, the next screen displays the category of facilities you can add (Hostel, Hotel, Homes/Apartments, House).
                 Only one category can be selected at a time. Select a category and tap on the “Next” button to go to the next screen.</li>
            <li>The set of options that would be displayed to you depends on the category of facilities you choose. The next set of steps
                and instructions are self-explanatory. Follow them carefully to successfully complete your quest for adding a new facility.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Note:</b> Some steps are compulsory, while others can be skipped.
