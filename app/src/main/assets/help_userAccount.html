            <p>It is obvious that, before you even get here, you
                should have created a user account already. But how do you see your account
                so that you can edit or delete it. Follow the following steps to do just that.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>First of all, navigate to “Profile” by tapping it at the bottom
                    of the main screen (Where you can find the list of facilities).
                    It is the last menu to the right in the menus at the bottom of your screen.</li>
                <li>Select the “Account settings” option to access
                    your user information, where you can change your profile picture, user name and many others. Check it out.</li>
                <p> <b>Kindly give us a feedback, if you face any difficulty.</b> </p>
