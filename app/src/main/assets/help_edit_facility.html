            <p>If you have added a facility, and you are wondering where you can find it,
                don’t worry, you can even edit or delete it. This section explains how you
                can edit or delete a facility. The following steps can help you out;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>First of all, navigate to <b>“Profile”</b>  by tapping it at the bottom
                    of the home screen (Where you can find the list of facilities).
                    It is the last menu to the right in the menus at the bottom of your screen.</li>
                <li>In the list of profile options, look for “Manage” (Manage replaces the “Lift a facility” option
                    which was available when you were adding a new facility). When you select this option,
                    your dashboard opens with a list of facilities you have added.</li>
                <li>You can edit or delete a facility by simply using the “Edit” and delete buttons respectively.</li>
