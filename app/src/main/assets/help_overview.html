            <p>This app is meant to solve the hassle people go through
                in finding shelter or accommodation when they find themselves in new vicinities.</p>
            <p> <i>We can help you find your next home. </i> </p>
            <p>This overview gives a brief description of the fundamental components and functionalities of the app.</p>
            <p>After signing in, the first page that opens is the main page which displays a list of facilities from which
                a user can view. All categories of facilities are displayed by default, but a user can scale down the
                list of facilities by switching between the tabs for each category. For example, a user view only facilities
                that are hotels by switching to the hotel tab.</p>
            <p>At the top of the main page is a primary search box where users can search facilities by name, town, country
                or place. For example, users can search for hostels in Kumasi by simply typing “Kumasi” in the search box.</p>
            <p>Basically, when a user opens the app, a Geofence is created using the user’s location to display the list
                of facilities closer to the user’s location at the top. This makes it simpler for users to find facilities
                within a geographic location.</p>
            <p>Any user who signs up would have the opportunity to add or view facilities. To see more details of a facility
                shown in the main page, a user would have to select the “View” button to see more information for that facility. The manager of a facility
                can be contacted through the app. Any conversation between a user and the manager can be seen under
                the “Inbox” menu. Facilities can also be rated by users.</p>
            <p>For advanced queries, a user can navigate to the “explore” option where queries can be made based
                on options like; price range, room type, amenities, location, level of restriction and many
                other options. It is awesome, you can check it out.</p>
            <p>A user can add as many facilities as needed with total control over them.</p>
            <p>There are several functionalities presented by the app, explore and give us a feedback if something is not clear.</p>
